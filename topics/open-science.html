<h1 id="introduction-to-and-motivation-for-open-science">Introduction to
and motivation for open science</h1>
<p>Open science has many aspects some equal it with reproducible
research and some with open access. Some equal open science to Science
2.0 or to science. We can say that open science consists of the
following components: open data (sharing of data with minimal
restrictions), open formats (storing data and text in a known
well-defined way), open standards (availability of definitions and their
practical usability), open source (vendor-independent software available
for modification, reuse, and distribution), open hardware (blueprints
for devices and other physical object), open methodology (openness about
all used methods and workflows), open peer review (reviewable process of
judging scientific work), open access (availability of scientific work,
especially journal articles), open educational resources (availability
and reusability of teaching materials). Some authors add additional
items and some remove from the list or use different, narrower or
broader, definitions. There are different reasons for doing open
science. The main group of reasons is represented by the following set
of (often loosely defined) terms: replicability, repeatability,
recomputability, reusability, and reproducibility.</p>
<p>This topic covers open science terms and motivation for open science.
Software and source code plays major role in several aspects of open
science. In the rest of the class, we will focus on software tools, open
source, and several other related concepts and tools. Some tools will be
general, some focused on the geospatial domain.</p>
<p>Get ready to use you computers during the class to try out things as
we will be discussing the different topics and learning the individual
tools. We will introduce and install the necessary software throughout
the semester. Most of the software we will use (locally or remotely) is
open source, so no university licensing or sign up for trial versions is
required. Exception are some cloud services which are not completely
open source, but allow any user a free registration and provide an easy
way to for the users to leave the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>Introduction paragraph: Write a sentence or two introducing yourself
to the class. Include your experience with any part of open science. You
can incorporate this with the text described below.</p>
<p>Summary paragraph: Review some of the resources above and post a
summary of two (or more) <em>Texts</em> or <em>Long videos</em> on the
course message board. This summary should be only one or two paragraphs
and should give overview of what you learned from the resources and how
can this change how you do research. Additionally, think about this text
as a help to other students who did not see this particular resource or
are deciding if it is worth to read it.</p>
<p>Post this to the <em>Assignment 1</em> thread on Moodle.</p>
