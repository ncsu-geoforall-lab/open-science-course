<p>In this part we focus on LaTeX, how to use with Overleaf, and we
compare it with Markdown and reStructuredText which can be used e.g.
with Pandoc.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<h3 id="overleaf">Overleaf</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.overleaf.com">https://www.overleaf.com</a></p>
<p>Overleaf is a freemium cloud platform with core processing backend -
LaTeX - which is open source software.</p>
<p>Overleaf project can be downloaded as a ZIP file of text files and
images which can be processed on any computer with LaTeX installed.
Typical LaTeX installation consist of several backend (command line)
tools such as <em>tex</em> or <em>pdflatex</em> and a dedicated text
editor, for example <em>Texmaker</em> or <em>Kile</em>, which
understands the LaTeX syntax and can compile the files into an output
document, typically PDF. Thanks to this, Overleaf is a cloud platform
which provides users with a way out, thus preserving their freedom (in
the area of software, tools, and service providers).</p>
<p>Overleaf also has a rich text mode which is good for people who don't
know LaTeX.</p>
<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>
<p>Here is an example LaTeX code:</p>
<pre><code>\section{This is a heading}

This is \emph{emphasis}.

\begin{itemize}
\item This is a list.
\item Of different items.
\end{itemize}</code></pre>

<p><strong>What is LaTeX?</strong> LaTeX is a typesetting system or
simply a program for creating text documents such as scientific papers
or posters. Generally speaking LaTeX is a desktop publishing (DTP)
program.</p>
<p><strong>How to pronounce LaTeX?</strong> The <em>La</em> at the
beginning is coming from original author Leslie Lamport who extended
<em>TeX</em>. The <em>X</em> at the end is an uppercase Greek letter
chi. In English, LaTeX is usually pronounced lah-tekh, lah-tek, or
lay-tek.</p>
<p><strong>What is LaTeX good for?</strong> The usage is very broad. It
is most commonly used for technical and scientific texts such as
scientific papers, dissertations, books and textbooks. It is also used
for presentation slides or scientific posters. The code can be easily
generated e.g. in Python, so it is used for automated generation of
PDFs.</p>
<p><strong>What LaTeX does?</strong> Besides common formatting of text
such as cursive and bold, LaTeX can automatically create table of
contents, numbered headings, cross references, footnotes, and literature
citations. Advantages of LaTeX are best visible when creating numbered
list and bullet points as everything is very organized and controlled.
When using LaTeX you don't have to think much about typographic rules or
know them because LaTeX will take of it.</p>
<p><strong>What is LaTeX best know for?</strong> LaTeX is often
highlighted as a tool to typeset math equations and the LaTeX syntax or
LaTeX itself is used in other tools to create math equations. LaTeX is
also generally better than other tools in typographically perfect
justification of text into block where LaTeX automatically and reliably
hyphenates words in different languages.</p>
<p><strong>What are the limitations of LaTeX?</strong> The workflow
usually requires The functionality of LaTeX is practically unlimited
since it is a full programming language. If LaTeX can't do something,
user can always program it to do it. Generally, this is of course not
practiced because there is a large amount of packages which usually
already cover the functionality you wish for.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to remember all the commands?</strong> That's not
necessary, because the common commands can be included using a button in
a editor. For complicated and less common commands, people usually use
existing examples online.</p>
<p><strong>What is the bare minimum I need to learn?</strong> The
important part are the concepts, not the exact commands. First part is
to become comfortable with textual representation of the formatting, for
example that the bold text is not in bold in source text but it is
marked with the specific command. Another part is that everything is a
command. Creating a table of contents is as simple as writing bold text,
it is one command.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between LaTeX and a text
editor?</strong> First, LaTeX is not a text editor. It is a program
which creates PDF or other documents from plain text files which contain
LaTeX commands. It is focused on text, not graphics, but it is actually
quite powerful in creating graphics as well. LaTeX is commonly used with
a text editor which understands LaTeX and supports user in writing LaTeX
documents. Things related to the text file such as spell checking are
handled by the text editor (rather than LaTeX).</p>
<p><strong>How is LaTeX used without Overleaf?</strong> As users, we
write text in a text editor which supports LaTeX. Whenever we run LaTeX
(e.g. using a button or shortcut the in editor), LaTeX creates a PDF
document (typically) which can be viewed in a PDF viewer (or embedded
viewer in the editor).</p>
<p><strong>How LaTeX works?</strong> As users, we add tags (or commands)
to the text which tell LaTeX how to process and typeset the text. It is
similar to how HTML and web browser work when formatting web pages.</p>

<p>Here is an example of one of the advanced things you can do in LaTeX
and that's definition of your own command. We will define command
<code>\gmod</code> which we will use in text to refer to GRASS GIS
modules (for the purpose of this example):</p>
<pre><code>\newcommand{\gmod}[1]{\emph{#1}}</code></pre>
<p>The parameter is refereed to using <code>#1</code>. Otherwise the
syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>\newcommand{\nameOfTheNewCommand}[number of parameters]{definition}</code></pre>
<p>Here is how we use it:</p>
<pre><code>Let&#39;s talk about some GRASS GIS modules, for example we can talk
about \gmod{g.region} or perhaps \gmod{r.shade}. The \gmod{v.buffer}
module is good too.</code></pre>
<p>So far we were defining just the style (emphasis in particular),
let's add a link to GRASS GIS documentation where name of the module is
part of the URL which looks for example like:</p>
<pre><code>https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/g.region.html</code></pre>
<p>The modified version of the command now uses <code>\href</code>
command which has two parameters, the URL and the text to show:</p>
<pre><code>\newcommand{\gmod}[1]{\href{https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/#1.html}{\emph{#1}}}</code></pre>
<p>During compilation, newlines are converted to spaces and whitespace
at the beginning of the line is ignored, so we can also write the same
on multiple lines. However, in that case, it is often necessary to (and
a best practice) to include percent signs at the end of the line as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>\newcommand{\gmod}[1]{%
    \href%
        {https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/#1.html}%
        {\emph{#1}}%
}</code></pre>

<p>ShareLaTeX is a freemium cloud platform and an open source software
(i.e. you can either use the freemium cloud platform or setup ShareLaTeX
on any server). ShareLaTeX is under GNU AGPL license.</p>
<p>You can use LaTeX in ShareLaTeX in the same way as you can use it in
Overleaf.</p>
<h3 id="markdown-with-pandoc">Markdown with Pandoc</h3>
<p><a href="http://pandoc.org">http://pandoc.org</a></p>
<p>Markdown is a simple markup language for include formatting into a
plain text document. Pandoc is a conversion tool which can convert
Markdown files and many other files into other formats.</p>
<p>Pandoc is licensed under GNU GPL.</p>
<h3 id="restructuredtext-with-sphinxdocutils">reStructuredText with
Sphinx/Docutils</h3>
<p>reStructuredText: <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html</a></p>
<p>Docutils: <a
href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">http://docutils.sourceforge.net</a></p>
<p>Sphinx: <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org">http://sphinx-doc.org</a></p>
<p><strong>reStructuredText</strong> is an plain text markup syntax
similar to aforementioned Markdown. It is often used for software
documentation, for example in Python docstrings. reStructuredText is,
unlike Markdown, designed for extensibility for specific application
domains. reStructuredText is applicable to non-trivial cases like LaTeX,
but still striving to keep simple syntax like Markdown.</p>
<p><strong>Docutils</strong> is an open-source text processing system
for processing plain text into formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, man-pages,
open-document or XML. Docutils processes reStructuredText and can be
used from command line or as a Python package. Another software which
can process reStructuredText in a similar manner is Pandoc.</p>
<p><strong>Sphinx</strong> is a tool that creates documentation from
reStructuredText sources. It is used for Python documentation and it is
universal enough to be used for software projects in general. The output
formats include HTML, LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, and
more. Sphinx uses the Docutils to parse the reStructuredText.</p>
<p>Sphinx is licensed under BSD and Docutils are placed into public
domain.</p>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>Take some of your documents which contain headings, figures, tables,
equations, and bibliography and recreate it in LaTeX. If you don't have
a suitable document, you can use this <a href="">paper</a> or any other
suitable document which contains all or most of the aforementioned
elements. Scientific papers will usually work. If you are writing a
report for assignment from another class, you can use that as well. In
any case, you don't have to recreate the whole document, include just
enough to try each of the elements.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already familiar with LaTeX, extend the
following LaTeX document in Overleaf by providing a comprehensive
description of some basic feature such as tables, equations or
bibliography, or introduction to some advanced feature or package. Here
is a read-only link for document (read-write link will be shared on the
message board):</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwmnkbcdrzmz">https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwmnkbcdrzmz</a></p>
<p>Three more alternative or bonus tasks: Create some other type of
document in LaTeX other than a paper, for example poster or presentation
slides (link a read-only version in the document linked above). Install
LaTeX on your computer and try the workflow on your desktop instead of
using Overleaf. Upload your resulting document to Overleaf and link it
and describe in the above document what your installed and did and what
were the other options you had. Use Pandoc, Docutils or Sphinx to create
a LaTeX document from some other format such as reStructuredText. Again,
upload and link the result and describe the process.</p>
